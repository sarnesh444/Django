This repo consists of the learning material of [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/).Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model-template-view architectural pattern.

I have taken up a Web Development Bootcamp Course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/),being a guy coming from python background I was keen on learning a backend framework 
that is in the skin of Python,I started with [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) it is a light weight micro-framework and gives developer the power,
but I was looking for a heavy framework that gives a lot of features Off-the-shelf or Out-of-the-box so Django was the answer it has lot of features like
* ORM
* User-Authentication
* Command-line Tool
* Support for CRUD
* Built-in SQLite Db
* and a lot more.....

This course gives basic insights into backend and how Django can be a life-saver in a lot of situtations

##### I will be sharing all the course content and my learnings from it here.
