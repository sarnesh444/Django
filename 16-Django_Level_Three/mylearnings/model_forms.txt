taking form input and passing it to the model

1.instead of extending the forms.Forms class in forms.py file in which we create a django form

since we would like to pass the forminput to a model so that it can be saved in db

instead of inherting the forms.Forms class into our [FormName](userdefined class that has django form that we created) 
we will inherit forms.ModelForm

2.add inline class called meta gives information of connecting model to form
	a.fields= __all__
	b.fields= include
	c.fields= exclude
