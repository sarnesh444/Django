{% load static %} used in html tells django that we would like to load static files


Websites generally need to serve additional files such as images, JavaScript, or CSS. In Django, we refer to these files as “static files”. Django provides django.contrib.staticfiles to help you manage them.

1.Configuring static files¶
Make sure that "django.contrib.staticfiles" is included in your INSTALLED_APPS.
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'first_app.apps.FirstAppConfig',
]


create a dir "static" under project
inside static create a dir for each app(since each django app will have it's own static files)
under static inside app folder create a dir for css and images
under images store the images for that django app


2.In your settings file, define STATIC_URL, for example:

"  STATIC_URL = '/static/'  " should be written in settings.py


3.In your templates, use the static template tag to build the URL for the given relative path using the configured STATICFILES_STORAGE.

{% load static %}
<img src="{% static "my_app/example.jpg" %}" alt="My image">
Store your static files in a folder called static in your app. For example my_app/static/my_app/example.jpg.



eg.
<!DOCTYPE html>
{% load static %}
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Django Guitar Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static "first_app/css/mystyle.css" %}"/>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hi, this is a picture of Django himself!</h1>
    <img src="{% static "first_app/images/djangoguitar.jpg" %}" alt="Uh Oh, didn't show!">
  </body>
</html>
