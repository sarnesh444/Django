say you would like to display dynamic text 

1.have a template tag in the html

eg.
{% extends "basic_app/base.html" %} 
    {% block body_block%}

    <h1>Hello and welcome to the site!</h1>
      <!-- <h1>This is the index.html page</h1> -->
    <h1>{{ number|add:99 }}</h1>
    {% endblock %}


"{% extends "basic_app/base.html" %}"  - this extends all the properties from the base.html


"{% block body_block%} {% endblock %}" - in the base.html nothing is written between these tags it is left empty,all the new properties in the child.html 
should be written between between these tags so it will be replaced in the empty space of the base.html so has new and old properties as well

"{{number}}"-placeholder,the dynamic content with key:val pair,here key will be equal to "number" and it will be replaced with a val coming from views.py

{{ number|add:99 }} - built in filter in django so the val coming from view.py is placed instead of "number" 
and "|" passes the val to a filter and "add" is the filter here,it adds a dynamic number coming from view.py with the static hard-coded number 99


2.views.py 

def index(request):
    context={'number':100}
    return render(request,'basic_app/index.html', context)


here 100 is passed as the number
