1.in the app/urls.py assign

"app_name=[nameofapp]"

{# Must set the app_name=basic_app variable inside the basic_app/urls.py#}

eg.
app_name = 'basic_app'

app_name=key word
basic_app=name of the app

=====================================

2.in the html to use relative url

<a href="{% url 'basic_app:other' %}">Link to other.html</a>

url-it is a keyword


basic_app-defined in urls.py
should match the one defined in urls.py like the line below
app_name = 'basic_app'



other-it is a parameter for the name attribute in path 
like the line below
eg.path('other/',views.other,name='other'),


now on clicking the anchor tag in html it will go to the  above line in basic_app/urls.py which will further re-direct to the "other" function in basic_app/views.py

caution:to make sure no errors occur ensure that there are no spaces before or after in this string 'basic_app:other' 


to link to the admins page using template taging
"{% url 'admin:index' %}"

to link to the index file
works if you have defined a 'index' path in the project/urls.py 

"{% url 'index' %}"
