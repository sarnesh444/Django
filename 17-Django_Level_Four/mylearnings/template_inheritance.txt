1.create a base.html from which other html files will extend

this is a placeholder everything in the html file outside this will be inherited to the files

" {% block body_block %}
    {# Anything outside of this will be inherited if you use extend.#}
{% endblock %} "

everything extra that is being written in the child.html should be written inside these so the new content will placed along with all the content from the base file


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Base</title>
    <!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css"
    integrity="sha384-MCw98/SFnGE8fJT3GXwEOngsV7Zt27NXFoaoApmYm81iuXoPkFOJwJ8ERdknLPMO" crossorigin="anonymous">

  </head>
  <body>
    <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
      <div class="navbar-nav">
        <a class="navbar-brand" href="{% url 'index' %}">DJANGO</a>
        <a class="nav-item nav-link" href="{% url 'admin:index' %}">Admin</a>
        <a class="nav-item nav-link" href="{% url 'basic_app:other' %}">Other</a>
      </div>
    </nav>

    <div class="container">
    {% block body_block %}
    {# Anything outside of this will be inherited if you use extend.#}
    {% endblock %}
    </div>

  </body>
</html>


2.now create another html file where you want to extend the properties of the base file 


<!DOCTYPE html>
{% extends "basic_app/base.html" %}
    {% block body_block %}
    <h1>This is an example of template inheritance!</h1>
    <h2>Officially this is the other.html page!</h2>
    {% endblock %}


here since we are extending the base file all it's properties are preserved 

and in the base file we have left the space empty between these two {% block body_block %} {% endblock %}

now whatever content is written inside {% block body_block %} {% endblock %} these in the child.html it will be replaced with the empty space in base.html and whole file is rendered
therefore has the new properties inside {% block body_block %} {% endblock %} and old properties have been inherited
