1. {{}}

{{ foo }} - this is a placeholder in the template,
for the variable foo that is passed to the template from a view.

2.{% %}
{%  %} - when text is surrounded by these delimiters,
it means that there is some special function or code running,
 and the result of that will be placed here. 
It is used when the text inside is not passed to the template from the view, 
but rather a function or feature of the template language itself that is being executed (like a for loop, or an if conditional). 
You can create your own extensions to the template language, which are called template tags.


3.filters with templates
{{ foo|something }} - this is yet another syntax you may come across. The |something is a template filter. It is usually for transforming the result of the item on the left of the | symbol. For example {{ foo|title }}.
